Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)


Understanding APIs
- An API allows communication between different software components, enabling data exchange without needing to know the backend processes.
- The API serves as the interface that users interact with, while the underlying library contains all program components.

REST APIs
- REST APIs facilitate communication over the internet, allowing access to resources like storage and algorithms.
- Key terms include client (your code), resource (web service), endpoint (service location), and HTTP methods for data transmission.

Examples of APIs
- The Watson Speech-to-Text API converts audio to text through a POST request, while the Watson Language Translator API translates text, demonstrating practical applications of REST APIs.
