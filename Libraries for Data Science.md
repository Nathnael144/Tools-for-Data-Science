     Libraries for Data Science

Scientific Computing Libraries
- Libraries like Pandas and NumPy provide built-in modules for data manipulation and mathematical operations, with Pandas offering a Data Frame for structured data handling.
- NumPy supports array and matrix operations, forming the foundation for many other libraries.

Visualization Libraries
- Matplotlib is a widely-used library for creating customizable graphs and plots, while Seaborn builds on Matplotlib to generate advanced visualizations like heat maps and violin plots.

Machine Learning and Deep Learning Libraries
- Scikit-learn offers tools for statistical modeling, including regression and classification, while Keras simplifies the building of deep learning models.
- TensorFlow serves as a low-level framework for large-scale deep learning, and PyTorch is favored for experimentation and research.
