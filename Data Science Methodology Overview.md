        Data Science Methodology Overview

Understanding Methodology
- A methodology is a structured system of methods used in a specific field, providing guidelines for researchers during the scientific process.
- In data science, methodology helps in making data-driven decisions and includes aspects like data collection, measurement strategies, and analysis methods.

Stages of Data Science Methodology
- The methodology consists of 10 stages: business understanding, analytic approach, data requirements, data collection, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, deployment, and feedback.
- Each stage is driven by key questions that help define the problem, organize data, and validate the approach for ongoing analysis.

Role of Questions in Data Science
- Questions are essential at every stage of the methodology, guiding the data scientist in defining issues, determining data needs, and validating the effectiveness of the data model.
- The methodology emphasizes the importance of asking the right questions to ensure successful outcomes in data science projects.
